The new Contact Us page has two main goals: 

To direct visitors to the contact most likely to resolve their query. 
To ensure Contact Us information is well managed. 

To help achieve these goals, we've developed the following guidelines. They are also available on the [IPP intranet site](http://icweb.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/ipp-ppi.nsf/eng/00614.html).

##Misdirected enquiries
If you receive any enquiries that are outside your unit's responsibility or appear to be misdirected, do not attempt to act on them. Refer them immediately to the Web Services Centre for resolution:

Industry Canada Web Services Centre
613-954-5031
1-800-328-6189 (toll-free)
info@ic.gc.ca

Please forward your misdirected enquiries in an email and provide as much detail as possible, including the client's name, email address, telephone number and itemized requests/questions.

We will be tracking these enquiries and using this data to adjust the Contact Us page as necessary. 

##Adding or removing contacts
If you want to remove currently listed contact information because your area is not mandated to resolve queries, or your group is mandated to resolve queries but is missing from the Contact Us page, please send the change request to icgc.web@ic.gc.ca.

##Updates
If you need to update your group or area's contact information on the Contact Us page, please send the change request to icgc.web@ic.gc.ca. We will update your information accordingly. We will be contacting you every 6Â months to confirm your contact information. 

##New web pages 
Contact Us is designed to reveal the contact information that is relevant to the page the user is visiting when he/she clicks on Contact Us. When setting up new subsites or applications on ic.gc.ca, do not create your own Contact Us page. Please forward your contact information to icgc.web@ic.gc.ca, and we will update the Contact Us page accordingly.

##Existing web pages 
When reviewing and updating your existing content, please ensure that it refers to Contact Us in the footer at the bottom of the page, as opposed to adding contact information directly into your page's content. This is key for maintaining consistency, measuring the effectiveness of the Contact Us page and meeting our goal of carefully managing contact information. 

When creating links to specific points within Contact Us in your content, please refer to the [coding instructions](http://icweb.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/ipp-ppi.nsf/eng/00615.html) to ensure that the relevant information appears when the link is clicked.

We welcome your suggestions for improving the Contact Us page. Please forward your ideas and recommendations to:
